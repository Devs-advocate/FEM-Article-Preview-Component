## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned

It's easier to manipulate SVG code that's placed directly in HTML.

### Continued development

CSS is not easy to master, and thus requires continued practice.
